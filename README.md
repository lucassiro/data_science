# deep_learning_path

This repository is a collection of code related to machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence.  
  
It includes several notebooks where I try to better understand various mechanisms related to AI, such as what a perceptron is, how the transformer works, convolution and much more.  
  
And also several notebooks in the areas of computer vision, natural language processing, generative AI and much more.  
  
My goal is to have a complete understanding of how some mechanisms work, and how to build, improve and fine tune models.
